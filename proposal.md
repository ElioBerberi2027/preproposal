## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mars My Red Planet

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A visual novel with minigames telling a story which can be altered based on decisions you make.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will be using Ren Py a very popular game engine for making visual novels. It will have doki doki style decision making which can alter what the characters say and where the story goes.
Minigames include stuff like a cookie clicker, character egagment and more. It hopefully will show a good story and good gameplay.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Next steps is researching the syntax of Ren Py and how to develop games. We will need to acquire many new skills such as story writing and game development. We will research how to make compelx games that include a lot of interactions. 
Right now everyone is doing a little bit of everthing but the main priorities we have is Micah for the story, me and andrew for the mini games.
